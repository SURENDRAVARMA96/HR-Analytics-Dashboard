# HR-Analytics-Dashboard

This project is an HR analytics dashboard created using Tableau that provides insights into employee information for a company. The project involved the following steps:

- Data gathering: The project used publicly available employee data from Kaggle, which contained records of employees in various departments of the company.

- Data cleaning: The raw data obtained from Kaggle was pre-processed and cleaned using Excel to ensure consistency and accuracy in the data. Duplicate records, incomplete records, and errors were removed or corrected as necessary.

- Data exploration: The cleaned data was analyzed and visualized using Tableau to identify patterns and trends in employee data. The analysis revealed insights on employee attrition rate, employee count, active employees, gender differences in the organization, and department contributions towards the company's success.

- Insights: Based on the data analysis, it was recommended that the company focus on encouraging young people in the R&D department to drive success with advancements in technology. The data also showed that the average age group of employees was 37, suggesting that the company should give more opportunities to younger people. Additionally, insights on employee attrition rate and active employees can help the company identify potential retention issues and take corrective action.

Overall, the HR analytics dashboard provides valuable insights into employee information for the company and can be used to make informed decisions about employee retention, career development, and departmental contributions towards the company's success.
